# Classifying Flower Species Using a K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Model

In this project, I built a machine-learning model based on data about flowers. The independent variables in the data were features such as sepal width and petal length. The target variables were flower species.

Once I had trained the model, I also evaluated how accurately it could predict the species of an unknown flower. The model achieved an accuracy score of&nbsp;97%.
